When a medical emergency happensâ€”say a heart attack, accident, stroke, organ failureâ€”you need ICU and emergency services at the same place. The ICU must have ventilators, continuous monitoring, intensivists, trained nurses, and backup systems. Plus, labs, X-ray, ultra, ECG should be accessible without moving the patient far.

Care and Cure Multispeciality Hospital in Ahmedabad offers a 24/7 emergency department that's directly connected to their ICU. They have wellâ€‘equipped wards and ventilators, real-time diagnostics, paediatric or adult ICU beds, trained staff, power backup, and infection control. So if you're in a serious condition, nothing has to be ferried elsewhere.
